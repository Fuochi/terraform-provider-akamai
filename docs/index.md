## Workflows

Here are the most common workflows for the Akamai Provider:

* **Set up the Provider the first time.** To do this, finish reviewing this guide, then go to [Get Started with the Akamai Terraform Provider
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ohurENF2epbu_Dx8X0fcYwAVU1ZEKh\--Wg1jV2AWuP4/edit?usp=sharing). When setting up the Provider, you need to choose an [authentication method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S39MM1sZNoM4EmlSLlPVYNohiH6x-Js0IoadUhU4vcc/edit), and decide whether to import existing Akamai configurations, or create new ones.
* **Add a new module to your existing Akamai Provider configuration.** If the Akamai  Provider is already set up, and you're adding a new module, read the guide for the module you're adding:
                              
  * [Application Security](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/akamai/akamai/latest/docs/guides/get_started_appsec)
  * [DNS Zone Administration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/akamai/akamai/latest/docs/guides/get_started_dns_zone)
  * [Global Traffic Management](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/akamai/akamai/latest/docs/guides/get_started_gtm_domain)
  * [Provisioning/Property Manager](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/akamai/akamai/latest/docs/guides/get_started_property)
*  **Update settings for an existing module.** Use the reference information for resource and data sources listed under each module, like DNS or Common. You can find this documentation on the panel to the left.

## Maintenance
<!--Might remove this heading as the two subheads won't appear in the right-hand TOC.-->

### Manage changes to your Akamai configurations

When you're using the Akamai Provider, you need to keep your 
Terraform configurations up to date with changes made using Akamai 
APIs, CLIs, and Control Center. You should review your network management 
processes and update them to include the Akamai Provider.

For example, before updating your Akamai Provider configurations, you may want to
 run `terraform plan` first. You'll likely receive warnings
and suggested changes. Once you fix any issues, you can run `terraform plan` 
again and make sure everything is in sync.
